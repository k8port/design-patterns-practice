= Merge Intervals

Pattern deals with problems involving overlapping intervals where each interval is represented by a start and end time.
Involves tasks like merging intersecting intervals, inserting new intervals into existing sets, and determining the minimum number of intervals needed to cover a given 
range. The most common types of problems solved using this pattern are event scheduling, resource allocation, and time slot consolidation.

The key to grasping the power of this algorithm pattern is understanding how any 2 intervals overlap.
