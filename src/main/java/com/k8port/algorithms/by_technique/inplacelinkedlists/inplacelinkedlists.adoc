= In-place Manipulation of Linked List

In-place manipulation of linked list pattern allows modification of a linked list without using additional memory. In-place means an algorithm that processes or modifies data structures using only existing memory space. The pattern is suited for problems requiring modification to the linked list structure, e.g., order of nodes. Some problems require reversing nodes in a linked list. 

The naive approach to reverse a linked list is to traverse it backwards and build a new linked list (time complexity O(n) and consumes O(n) space. Implement an-place reversal of nodes using no extra space. Iterate over the linked list while keeping track of three nodes: current node, next node, and previous node. Keeping track of these three nodes allows effective reversal of the links between each pair of nodes. In-place reversal of a linked list works in O(n) time and consumes O(1) space.
