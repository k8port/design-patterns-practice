[Overview of Modified Binary Search Pattern%collapsible]

Modified binary search pattern is an extension of traditional binary search algorithm and is applicable to a wide range of problems.

.Classic Binary Search
====

NOTE: Recap of `classic binary search`, an algorithm used to find target values in sorted arrays or lists that support direct addressing (e.g., random access). 

Follows `divide-and-conquer` approach, significantly reducing search space each iteration.

Uses 3 indices: `start`, `end`, and `middle` as follows:
[unordered]
1. Set `start` and `end` indices to first and last elements of an array.
2. Calculate position of `middle` index using average of `start` and `end`.
3. Compare target value with element at `middle` index.
4. If target value equal to `middle`, return element at `middle` as target value.
5. If target value less than `middle`, update `end` to `middle` âˆ’ 1 and repeat from step 2 on. (_Since array is sorted, values between `middle` and `end` are greater than target value and its safe to eliminate this half of search space_).
6. If target value greater than `middle`, update start index to `middle + 1` and repeat from step 2. (_Safe to eliminate smaller half of search space_).
7. Continue until target value is found or search space exhausted (`start` crosses `end`).

Reaches target value in `O(log(n))` time since array is divided in 2 at each step.  Brute-force approach requires traversal of entire array without partitioning and takes `O(n)` as worst case.

.Explanation of Modified Binary Search
====

Note: Modified binary search is an algorithmic pattern that builds upon `classic binary search` algorithm by applying certain conditions or transformations, allowing for solution of problems where input data is modified.

Common variations include:
[unordered]
*Binary search on modified array*::  [.small]#e.g., sorted and rotated around a pivot, having a condition. To handle, modify binary search to detect anomalies to sorted order.#
*Binary search with multiple requirements*::  [.small]#e.g., target value. Adapt comparison logic to accommodate multiple specifications, e.g., finding target range, finding leftmost/rightmost occurrence of target value.#

TIP: Use pattern when problem matches criteria outlined below.

---
[unordered]
*Target value in sorted data*:: Involves locating specified target value or identifying first or last occurrence of within sorted array or list.
*Partially sorted segments*:: Segments of input array are sorted.

Warning: Avoid pattern when problem matches criteria outlined below.

[unordered]
---
*Lack of direct addressing*:: Input data structure does not support direct addressing.
*Unsorted or inappropriately sorted data*:: data to search is _not_ sorted according to relevant criteria.
*Non-value-based solutions*:: Problem does not require identifying specific value or range of values.

== Real World Applications of Modified Binary Search Pattern
[unordered]
*Dictionary searches*:: [.small]#Uses classic binary search to find required words in alphabetized list. To find all words in dictionary sharing common prefix, modify comparison operation.#
*Range-based filtering*:: [.small]#Finds range-based information using modified binary search algorithm, e.g., to filter YouTube videos by time range, filtering bank transactions by dates, finding test scores within a range.#
*String searching algorithms*:: [.small]#Uses adapted modified binary search for string search, e.g., searching on suffix array, longest common prefix (LCP) array (used in bioinformatics for DNA sequence analysis, text processing, and search engines).#
