### Enterprise use cases for Two Pointers Technique
[unordered]
 Memory Management:: Pattern is vital to memory allocation and deallocation processes.  A memory pool is initialized with two pointers: one pointing to the start of an available memory space (e.g., block, pool, etc.) and the other pointing to the end. When a process or data structure requests memory allocation, the start pointer moves forward, designating a new memory space for allocation.  When memory is deallocated, the start pointer shifts back, marking deallocated memory as available for reuse.  The end pointer remains static, indicating the total size of the memory pool.
Data Compression:: Two-pointer technique is used in data compression algorithms like Run-Length Encoding (RLE). The algorithm iterates through the data, comparing each character with the next one.  When a sequence of identical characters is identified, the RLE algorithm replaces the sequence with a single character and a count of the number of occurrences.
String Manipulation:: Two-pointer technique is used in string manipulation algorithms like reverse string, check palindrome, etc.  The algorithm iterates through the string, comparing characters from the start and end simultaneously.
