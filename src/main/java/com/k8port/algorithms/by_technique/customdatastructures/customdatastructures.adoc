[Overview of Custom Data Structures%collapsible]
Many coding problems can be solved optimally using existing data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and trees, but sometimes none of them fit the requirements of the problem and provide the desired efficiency.  In these cases it's wise to implement a custom data structure using basic data structures as building blocks and incorporating unique features and behaviors specific to the problem. Custom data structures are best describes as modified versions of or unique combinations of existing data structures.

.Example: Build a Web Crawler
====
Web crawlers statr with a set of seed URLs, visits each one, finds links, and follows these links, add new URLs to the queue to visit.  It requires processing many, many pages and URLs, storing them and managing URLs efficiently while avoiding duplication of effort and prioritizing some over others. An optimal custom data structure could be a `URLQueue`.

=== Common Data Structures Used for Underlying Implementation
A list of common data structures and their most significant properties.
[unordered]

`Arrays`
[unordered]
* Stores fixed-size collection of same data type
* Elements stored sequentially in memory
* Accessible via index
* Insertion and deletion operations limited by requirement to shift elements

`Linked Lists`
[unordered]
* Used to implement stacks, queues, graphs, etc.
* Naturally dynamic size - memory allocated as needed
* Random access not supported (address of nodes cannot be calculated)
* Accessing an element requires traversing strucure and is `O(n)`
* Basic insertion/deletion `O(1)` (insertion/deletion at kth element `O(n)`)

`Hash Maps`
[unordered]
* Key-value pair data storage
* Accessible by key, insetion/deletion/lookup operations `O(1)`
* Can store different data types
* Collision resolution required

`Trees`
[unordered]
* Undirected graphs with no cycles
* Every node has parent except for root
* Binary trees: parent has <= 2 children, N-ary Tree: parent has <= N children
* Naturally recursive due to hierarchical structure
* Common traversals include depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS)
* Subtypes include binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, red-black trees, heaps, tries, and n-ary trees
