[Overview of Stacks Pattern%collapsible]
Stacks are linear data structures used to organize and manage data using a "Last In, First Out (LIFO)" process pattern.

Fundamental operations of the Stack are `push` and `pop`, used to add and remove elements accordingly while maintaining LIFO order.

An important property of Stack is `capacity` which is its size. Vital to track stack capacity while performing to avoid stack overflows or underflows.

.Stack Implementation
====
Implemented using either `array` or `linked list` data structures:
[unordered]
*Array Implementation*:: [.small]#Stack represented as fixed size array where elements are added and removed from one end and pointer used to tract top.#
*Linked List Implementation*:: [.small]#Stack elements represented as node in linked list and top of stack is head of list.#

TIP: Use when problem matches criteria outlined below.

[unordered]
*Reverse order processing*:: [.small]#involves processing elements in reverse order or last element added must be processed first.#
*Nested structures handling*:: [.small]#involves nested structures, e.g., brackets, parentheses, nested function calls.#
*State tracking*:: [.small]#requires keeping track of previous states or undoing operations.#
*Expression evaluation*:: [.small]#involves evaluating expressions.#
---
Conditions NOT matching criteria for solving with Stacks:
[unordered]
*Order dependence*:: [.small]#requires either a different order dependence than Last In, First Out (LIFO) or there is no order dependency at all.#
*Random access*:: [.small]#involved frequent access or modification of elements at arbitrary positions is needed and not just from the end.#
*Need for searching*:: [.small]#requires efficient searching for elements based on values or properties.#

== Real World Applications of Stacks Pattern
[unordered]
*Function call stack*:: [.small]#Stacks used to manage function calls in programming languages. When function called context pushed onto stack and when function completes, it is popped.#
*Text editor undo/redo feature*:: [.small]#Stacks used to undo/redo changes made during editing. Each edit operation is pushed onto stack, allowing users to revert to previous state by popping most recent edit.#
*Browser back and forward buttons*:: [.small]#Back and forward navigation in web browsers implemented using a stack to track visited pages. Clicking back button pops current page while clicking forward button pushes it onto stack.#
*Call history in smartphones*:: [.small]#Maintainence of call history stack allows users to navigate through recent calls.#
*Expression evaluation*:: [.small]#Stacks used to store elements with sequential dependencies in mathematical expressions. `2+3Ã—7` Stack used to enforce order of operations.#
*Transaction history in banking apps*: [.small]#Stacks help maintain secure and ordered transaction histories.  Transactions are pushed onto stack at once ensuring that most recent transaction is always the most easily accessible.#
