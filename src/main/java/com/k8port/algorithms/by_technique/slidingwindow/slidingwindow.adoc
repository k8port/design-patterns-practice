= Sliding Window

Sliding window is a pattern used to process sequential data, arrays, and strings, i.e., subarray or substring problems. It involves maintaining a dynamic window that slides through the array or string, adjusting boundaries as needed. The window is used to slide over the data in chunks corresponding to window size, which can be set according to the problem’s requirements. It can be seen as a variation of the two pointers pattern, with the pointers being used to set the window bounds.

Imagine you’re in a long hallway lined with paintings, looking through a narrow frame that only reveals a portion of the hallway at any time. As you move the frame, new paintings come into view while others leave. The process of moving and adjusting what’s visible is how sliding window technique operates over data.

Consider a problem that requires finding `k` consecutive integers with the largest sum in an array. Time complexity of a naive solution is O(kn) since  all subarrays of size k must be computed. Using sliding window pattern involves subtracting the element exiting the window and adding the element entering the window to update maximum sum, allowing sums to be updated in constant time, and yielding an overall time complexity of O(n).

Computations performed each time the window moves take O(1) time or would be a slow-growing function, e.g., log of a small variable.

.[.small]#Problem Characteristics for Sliding Window Technique#

* *Sequential data*: data is sequential, e.g., array, string, etc.
* *Subarray or substring*: problem involves finding a subarray or substring.
* *Dynamic window*: window size is dynamic and can change based on problem requirements.
* *Sliding window*: window slides over data structure, adjusting boundaries as needed.
* *Computations per window movement are O(1)*: computations performed each time the window moves take O(1) time or would be a slow-growing function, e.g., log of a small variable.
