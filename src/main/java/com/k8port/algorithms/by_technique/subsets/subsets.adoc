[Overview of Subsets Pattern%collapsible]

Subsets pattern is used to solve problems involving all possible combinations of elements from a given data structure.  Useful when dataset is a `Set` containing unique elements or arrays/lists containing duplicate elements. Used to generated all subsets based on conditions of given problem.

Most commonly, subsets are built incrementally, either including or excluding elements depending on problem constraints and process continued for remaining elements.

.How to build a Subset
====
1. Begin with initial subset `subsets = [[]]`.  
2. Process array elements while expanding list of subsets: 
3. Iterate all existing subsets 
4. For each `num` in `arr`: 
[ordered, indent=2]
a. create new subset
b. append `num` to new subset
c. append `num` to each existing subset
d. append new subset to list of subsets
5. Return list of subsets.

TIP: Know difference between alogirthmic patterns and programming patterns.

.Backtrarcking 
`Backtracking pattern` is used generate required subsets of given data structure: it applies to broader range of problems where evaluating all possibilities is required and having various constraints, rules, or conditions. 
Not all backtracking problems involve finding subsets which is why its necessary to discuss Subsets as separate programming pattern.
