= Greedy

Greedy is an algorithmic approach for tackling optimization problems where the goal is to find the optimal solution under given constraints.

Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds upon a solution piece by piece through a series of choices, each time choosing best option in given moment,
(e.g., greedy choice). Future implications of choices are not considered, only maximizing immediate benefits and choosing next thing offering most -
an approach used to solve optimization problems.

Greedy works by constructing solution from smallest possible constituent parts. The best solution is not always the one found since  always opting for immediate benefit, better options available later on can be missed. Greedy algorithms can get stuck in whatâ€™s called `local optimal solution` without finding `global optimal solution`.

A classic example is in organizing networks, e.g., connecting computers using least amount of cable. Primâ€™s algorithm uses a greedy method to efficiently find minimum amount of cable necessary to connect all computers in a network.

Greedy algorithms offer straightforward and effective way to solve optimization problems through making most advantageous choice at any given step.

TIP: Use pattern when problem matches criteria outlined below.

.Characteristics of Greedy Pattern
[unordered]
*Optimization Problems*:: Finding the best possible solution under given constraints, e.g., maximizing or minimizing value like cost, distance, time, etc.
*Making local choices leads to global solution*:: Problem solved by making simple decisions based on current best option or state without looking ahead.

.Problem characteristics NOT suitable for Greedy Technique:
*Local choice leads to sub-optimal global*:: Making simple choice based on current best option or state leads to sub-optimal result.
*Problem lacks clear local options*:: Problem doesn't naturally break down into series of choices where best option can be identified.
