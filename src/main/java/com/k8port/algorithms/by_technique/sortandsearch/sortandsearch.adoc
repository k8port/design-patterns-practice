[Overview of Sort and Search Pattern%collapsible]
Sort and search is a widely-used problem-solving technique to address challenges surrounding the how data is organized.  The technique uses sorting and efficient search to simplify problem-solving. Sorting input data before solving many problems creates an ordered structure that enhances searching, comparing, and optimizing processes and reduces overall time complexity. Once data sorted, applying efficient search methods like `binary search` or `two-pointers` searching and validations, becomes easier and leads to a more optimized approach.

.Benefits of Sorting in Sort and Search Pattern
====
Sorting input data is critical to sort and search because it organizes information and identifies key relationships between elements. 

Key Advantages of Sorting:
1. To be able to determine quickly value of a given element and its size relative to other elements contained in the data. 
2. Specifies ranges and boundary conditions in the data to be able to apply binary search or similar search techniques.
3. Eliminates duplication of effort by handling dataset comparisons prior to implementation of other problem-solving techniques.
4. Groups related items together, aligning elements optimally for operations.
5. Reveals hidden patterns in the data which can reveal which problem-solving technique to employ
====

== Search techniques
After data is sorted, technique calls for a search application to be applied. Most common search technique is `binary search`, an algorithm that narrows search space by repeatedly dividing it into smaller sections and is particularly useful For locating and matching elements within a sorted dataset. Two-pointer approach is also powerful, where two pointers are positioned at opposite ends of the sorted data and move toward each other based on specific conditions or criteria.

.Characteristics of Sort and Search Pattern
[unordered]
*Sortable data*:: [.small]#Input data is sortable prior to applying search techniques (e.g., arrays or lists of numbers) and sorting input clarifies relationships between elements and simplifies operations.#
*Pairwise and ordered comparisons*:: [.small]#Problem involves comparing pairs or subsets of data elements to identify specific relationships or conditions, where comparisons depend on relative order of elements.#
*Range-based values*:: [.small]#Task involves identifying or processing elements within a specific range or threshold.#
*Optimization based on relationships*:: [.small]#Problem requires optimizing a solution by evaluating how data elements relate, such as finding maximum or minimum values or optimal distances between them.#
*Efficient searching methods*:: [.small]#Problem benefits from efficient searching methods like binary search, two-pointer traversal, sliding window, etc., to reduce complexity.#
