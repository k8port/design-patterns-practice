[Overview of Hash Maps%collapsible]
Hash maps store key-value powers, efficiently mapping keys to values and providing fast lookups. Efficiency is achieved through has function that computes and index for each key. Index is used to determine position of corresponding value in underlying array.

.Hash Map Methods
====
* `Insert(key, value)`: On insertion, hash function computes index for key which is uded to find position to store value. Since different keys can hash to same index (collision), hash maps usually include collision resolution strategy that uses chaining, open addressing or other techniques. Average case time complexity is `O(1)`, assuming uniform distribution of keys.  In worst case time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is number of keys in hash map.
* `Search(key)`: On search, hash function computes index for key and retrieves value from corresponding position in underlying array. Average case time complexity is `O(1)`, assuming uniform distribution of keys. In worst case time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is number of keys in hash map.
* `Remove(key)`: Removing key-value pair ordinarily involved finding index by key's hash value and removing value stored at index. In average case time complexity is `O(1)`, assuming uniform distribution of keys. In worst case time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is number of keys in hash map.
