= Top K Elements

[Overview of Top K Elements%collapsible]
`Top k elements` pattern is a technique used to efficiently find a specified number (`k`) of elements.  Used when task is to identify largest, smallest, or most/least frequent elements within an _unsorted_ collection.

Naive approach involves first sorting entire collection (`O(nlog(n))` and selecting top `k` elements `(O(k))`. 

Using Top K Elements pattern bypasses need for full sorting by managing which elements to compare and track, reducing time complexity to `O(nlogk)``.

Uses `Heap` to track smallest/largest `k` elements (max or min heap) since it allows efficient maintainence of elements.

Tip: Use min heap to find smallest elements and max heap to find largest.

Steps:

1. Insert first k elements from a given set of elements into heap.
2. Iterate through remaining elements of given set.
3. If element found smaller/larger than top, remove top element and insert the smaller/larger element

Efficiency comes from heap's ability to insert and remove elements in `O(logk)` time.  Only `k` elements from heap require maintenance, and these operations are quick.  `n` elements in the given set can be processed in `O(nlogk)` time.

.[.small]#Characteristics of Top K Elements Pattern:#

* *Unsorted list analysis*: Extracting specified subset of elements based on size (largest or smallest), frequency (most or least frequent), or other similar criteria from an unsorted list is a requirement of the final solution, or necessary as an intermediate step.
* *Identifying specified subset*: Identifying a subset rather than just a single extreme value. Look for phrasing like `top k`, `kth largest/smallest`, `k most frequent`, `k closest`, or `k highest/lowest`.

.[.small]#Problem characteristics NOT good for pattern:#
* *Presorted Input*: Having pre-sorted input data.
* *Find Single Extreme Value*: Asking to find a single, extreme value from a dataset.
