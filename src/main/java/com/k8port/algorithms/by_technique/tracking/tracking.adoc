[Overview of Tracking%collapsible]
Knowing What to Track is technique used to solve problems that require keeping track of information as iterations are performed on data structure. Tallying when customers purchase a certain item, or tracking number of times a user has clicked on an ad are examples of problems requiring tracking.

Tracking involves counting occurrences of elements in a data structure (usually an array or string) and using this frequency to efficiently solve a problem. 

.Tracking's Two Main Phases
====
* `Counting Occurrences`:: [.small]#Counting occurrences of certain events or values using data structures like hash maps, dictionaries, arrays, or simple variables.#
* `Utilization phase`:: [.small]#Using stored frequencies to compute some result.#
====

Tracking with arrays instead of hash maps is more efficient when it's known in advance the range of elements and if range is relatively small compared to dataset.

*Frequency tracking*:: [.small]#Involves counting frequencies of elements in dataset, individually or in combinations.#
*Pattern recognition*:: [.small]#Patterns in data are identifiable where certain elements or combinations of elements repeat frequently.#
*Fixed Set of possibilities*:: [.small]#Problem requires choosing output from fixed set of possibilities, e.g., Yes/No, True/False, etc.#
