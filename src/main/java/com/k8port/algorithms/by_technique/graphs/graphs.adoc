[Overview of Graphs Pattern%collapsible]
Graphs are non-linear data structures used to represent connections or relationships between entities.  In graph theory, entities are represented as vertices (nodes) and connections between them are expressed as edges.

== Types of Graphs
[unordered]
*Directed Graph*:: [.small]#Edges have direction and indicate flow of data.#
*Undirected Graph*:: [.small]#Edges have no direction and indicate relationship without specific flow.#
*Weighted Graph*:: [.small]#Edges have value that represent cost or distance between vertices.#
*Cyclic Graph*:: [.small]#Edges form cycle, indicating multiple paths between vertices.#
*Acyclic Graph*:: [.small]#Edges do not form cycle, preventing multiple paths between vertices.#

== Graph Representation
[unordered]
*Adjacency Matrix*:: [.small]#2D array representing edges between nodes. `matrix[i][j]` is edge between node `i` and node `j`. A value of 1 indicates an edge of unweighted graph, or value of edge weight if weighted.#
*Adjacency List*:: [.small]#Collection of lists with each list corresponding to a graph node and its neighbors. In case of weighted graph, list elements also contain weight values.#

[discrete]
== Graph Traversals
Solving problems related to graphs requires knowledge of graph traversal techniques.

[unordered]
*Breadth-First Search (BFS)*:: [.small]#Explores all nodes at current depth prior to moving on to nodes at next depth level.#
*Depth-First Search (DFS)*:: [.small]#Explores path all the way to a leaf node before backtracking.#

.Depth-First Search (DFS)
====
Strategy involves exploring as far as possible along one path before turning back. Starts with chosen source node and proceeds to a neighboring node and tracking it as `visited`. Proceeds to a different neighbor and marks `visited`. This continues until it reaches a node with no neighbors. Now, the algorithm starts backtracking. In backtracking, the algorithm goes one step back and checks for the remaining neighbor nodes that are yet to be explored. This process continues until all the nodes in the graph, that are reachable from the source node, have been visited.

.DFS Steps
1. Choose source node and mark "visited".
2. Proceed to source node's first neighbor and mark "visited".
3. Proceed to another neighbor of source node and mark "visited".
4. Continue until reaching node with no neighbors.
5. Backtrack and repeat until all nodes are visited.

.DFS Implementation
1. Initialize empty stack 
2. Push source node coordinates onto stack, and mark as `visited`.
3. While stack is not empty, pop node from stack.
4. Explore unvisited neighbors of popped node, push to stack and mark as `visited`.
5. Repeat until stack is empty.
====

.Breadth-First Search (BFS)
====
Strategy is to explore graph in layers, one level at a time. 

.BFS Steps
1. Begin at chosen source node and visit all immediate neighbors while marking as visited.
2. Visit neighbors of neighbor nodes before proceeding to next level.
3. Process continues until all nodes in graph reachable from source node are visited.

.BFS Implementation
1. Initialize empty queue
2. Enqueue source node and mark as `visited`.
3. While queue is not empty, dequeue node from front of queue.
4. Visit immediate neighbors of dequeued node, enqueue and mark as `visited`.
5. Repeat until queue is empty.
