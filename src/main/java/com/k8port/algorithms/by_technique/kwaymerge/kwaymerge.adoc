= K-Way Merge

[Overview of K-Way Merge%collapsible]
K-way merge pattern is an essential algorithmic strategy for merging sorted data structures like arrays and linked lists into a single structure. The technique expands on `merge sort` algorithm.

`K-way merge algorithm` works by repeatedly selecting smallest or largest element from size `K` input and adding it to result list, repeating this process until all elements given input lists have been merged into output and maintained a sorted order.

K-way merge can be implemented one of two ways. 

.minheap implementation
====
Using minheap:

1. Insert first element from each list into a min heap to efficiently track the smallest current element among all lists.
2. Remove smallest element from heap (always at top) and add to output list.
3. Track list from which each element came to know where to find next element to add to heap.
4. After removing the smallest element and adding it to output, replace it next element from origin list.
5. Repeat steps 2â€“4 until all elements from all input lists have been merged into output list.
====

.pairwise implementation
====
Grouping and merging pairs of lists, which simplifies merging process by reducing it to a series of merges:

1. Divide K sorted lists into pairs.
2. For each pair of lists, peform 2-way merge, resulting in k/2 merged lists.
3. If an odd number of lists results at any point, leave one list unmerged in that round to ensure no list left out of merge process.
4. Repeat process of pairing resulting lists and meerging until only one sorted list remains.

.[.small]#Characteristics of K-way Merge Pattern#

* *Merging sorted arrays or matrices*: Problem involves collection of sorted arrays with rows or cols sorted and requires merging them.
* *Finding kth smallest/largest across sorted collections*: Problem requires finding kth smallest or largest element across multiple lists.

== Real World Applications of K-Way Merge
[unordered]
*Patient Records Aggregation*:: [.small]#In healthcare informatics, patient data can come from multiple sources (e.g., lab results, physician notes, imaging reports, etc.), each sorted by date or priority.  Requires integrating into single patient record.#
*Merging Financial Transactions Stream*:: [.small]#Financial institutions process transactions across multiple sources like trades, payments, transfers, etc. Analysts require merged data to perform real-time market analysis or detect fraud.#
*Log File Analysis*:: [.small]#Large-scale web services generate log files from multiple servers in chronological order that must be merged into single stream.#
