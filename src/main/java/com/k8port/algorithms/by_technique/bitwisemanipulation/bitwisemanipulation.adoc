[Overview of Bitwise Manipulation%collapsible]
All data is stored in computer memory in binary format: 0s and 1s.  Bitwise manipulation is a technique used to manipulate binary data using bitwise operators.  Logical bitwise operations are the fastest operations there are because processors natively support them. Bitwise manipulation is a technique that can efficiently transforms input into binary form or manipulates it directly at bit level to procduce problem solutions.

=== Important!!: Binary Numbers
***

IMPORTANT: !! &nbsp; Binary numbers can be *unsigned* or *signed*.
[horizontal]
*Unsigned*:: `0 to 2^n^ - 1`
*Signed*:: `-2^(n-1)^ to 2^(n-1)^ - 1`

***

Bitwise operation works on bit strings, bit arrays, or bit numerals. They take bits as their operands and calculate bit value in result.

|flips bit values
|AND
|&
|binary
|evaluates two bits to 1 if both are 1, otherwise 0
|OR

|binary
|evaluates two bits to 1 if either is 1, otherwise 0
|XOR
|`^`
|binary
|evaluates two bits to 1 if both are different, otherwise 0
|LEFT SHIFT
|`<<`
|binary
|shifts bits to left
|RIGHT SHIFT
|`>>`
|binary
|shifts bits to right
|ARITHMETIC LEFT SHIFT (Positive)
|`+`
|binary
|maintains sign bit; remaining bits shift left; fills vacated bits with 0s
|ARITHMETIC LEFT SHIFT (Negative)
|`-`
|binary
|maintains sign bit; remaining bits shift left; fills vacated bits with 0s
|ARITHMETIC RIGHT SHIFT (Positive)
|`+`
|binary
|maintains sign bit; remaining bits shift right; fills vacated bits with 0s
|ARITHMETIC RIGHT SHIFT (Negative)
|`-`
|binary
|maintains sign bit; remaining bits shift right; fills vacated bits with 1s
|CYCLIC SHIFT
|`>>>` or `<<<`
|binary
|shifts bits left or right; vacated bits reintroduced at opposite end

*Binary Representation*:: input data usefully manipulated using primitive bitwise logical operations to compute portion of or entire solution.
*Efficient Sorting*:: input data is unsorted and solution involves sorting more efficiently.
